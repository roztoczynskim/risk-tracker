### 7. **Advanced Features**
- [ ] Add file attachments to risks
- [ ] Implement user authentication
- [ ] Create dashboard charts and metrics
- [ ] Add risk severity levels (High, Medium, Low)
- [ ] Implement risk categories/tags

### 8. **Integration & Automation**
- [ ] Connect to Jira for automatic epic import
- [ ] Set up Slack/Teams notifications
- [ ] Create automated risk status reports
- [ ] Integrate with project management tools

### 9. **Production Deployment**
- [ ] Move from SQLite to PostgreSQL/MySQL
- [ ] Set up proper hosting (AWS, Azure, Digital Ocean)
- [ ] Configure SSL certificates
- [ ] Set up monitoring and backups
- [ ] Create user documentation

## üéØ Phase 4: Team Adoption & Governance (Ongoing)

### 10. **Process Integration**
- [ ] Train team members on the system
- [ ] Establish risk review meeting cadence
- [ ] Create risk escalation procedures
- [ ] Set up regular risk assessment workflows

### 11. **Continuous Improvement**
- [ ] Gather user feedback and iterate
